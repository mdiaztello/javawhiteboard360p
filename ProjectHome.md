## Abstract ##
We developed a proof-of-concept cross-platform whiteboard application for individuals to visually and textually communicate with each other over the internet. We developed this application to allow individuals to enter an environment where they can all view and draw on a shared whiteboard to communicate information visually and type text messages to each other. The application is mostly distributed such that a central server is only needed to handle the whiteboard session requests from clients as they join and leave the whiteboard session. Clients communicate with each other in a broadcasting fashion which does not involve a heavy need for a centralized communication server. The potential application for this project can apply to virtualized project meetings, real-time collaborative problem solving, and remote visually oriented mathematics tutoring.
