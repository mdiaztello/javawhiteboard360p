# javawhiteboard360p
This is an old repository from when I took EE360P (Concurrent and Distributed Programming in Java) at UT.
It implements a multi-user whiteboard/chat system for working collaboratively on things like math tutoring.
I've decided to preserve this project rather than let it go away since google is shutting down its code hosting 
service, but I don't think I intend to update this code in the future.
